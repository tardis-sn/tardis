Radiative Monte Carlo
*********************

.. :currentmodule:: tardis.montecarlo_multizone

We assume the supernova is in homologous expansion, and we assume that
there is photon injection from an inner boundary, and we assume an outer boundary
where these photons can leave the simulation again.


Monte Carlo packets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Monte Carlo packets have a frequency, angle (:math:`\mu=\cos{\theta}` )
and an energy: :math:`P(\nu, \mu, \epsilon)`. A large number :math:`n` is generated
at the start of each Monte Carlo run in TARDIS by drawing :math:`\nu` from a
black-body distribution distribution with a :math:`\mu` being drawn from a
:math:`\sqrt[2]{z}` distribution and an
energy that is :math:`1/n`.

These packets are then launched into the simulation, and there are two possible
outcomes for each packet.

 * **packet leaves the simulation through the outer bound** and counts towards the
    spectrum
 * **packet leaves the simulation through the inner boundary** and is lost
    (reabsorbed)

The packets can gain and lose energy throughout the simulation. If these packets
scatter (through the various mechanisms), we transform into the co-moving frame at
that position :math:`v(r) = r / t_\textrm{explosion}`, where :math:`t_\textrm{explosion}`
is the time since explosion with the Doppler factor
:math:`d_\textrm{rest \rightarrow comoving}`, then change direction from
:math:`\mu_\textrm{in}` to :math:`mu_\textrm{out}` and transform back and
change the energy accordingly:

.. math::
    d_\textrm{rest \rightarrow comoving} = 1 - \mu_\textrm{in} v(r) / c \\
    d_\textrm{rest \rightarrow comoving} = 1 - \mu_\textrm{out} v(r) / c \\
    E_\textrm{after scatter} = E_\textrm{before scatter} \times \frac{1 - \mu_\textrm{in} v(r) / c}{1 - \mu_\textrm{out} v(r) / c}

This way, the Monte Carlo packets can gain or lose energy in the simulation:

.. plot:: physics/pyplot/plot_mu_in_out_packet.py




The spectrum is then generated as a weighted histogram. For each bin with edges
:math:`\nu_{n}, \nu_{n+1}`, we get all the packets that left the simulation through
the outer boundary and add up their remaining energies.



Monte Carlo Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before any packet action is performed, we calculate four different distances
 ( :math:`d_\textrm{inner}, d_\textrm{outer}, d_\textrm{line}, d_{\textrm{e}^{-}}` )

The calculations for the distance to the outer boundary:

The calculations for the distance to the inner boundary:

Radiation field estimators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the Monte Carlo run, we collect two estimators for the radiation field:

.. math::

    J_\textrm{estimator} &= \sum{\epsilon l}\\
    \bar{\nu}_\textrm{estimator} &=  \sum{\epsilon \nu l},

where :math:`\epsilon, \nu` are co-moving energy and co-moving frequency of a packet, respectively.

To calculate the temperature and dilution factor, we first calculate the mean intensity in each cell
( :math:`J = \frac{1}{4\pi\, \Delta t\, V} J_\textrm{estimator}` )., :cite:`2003A&A...403..261L`.

The weighted mean frequency is used to obtain the radiation temperature. Specifically, the radiation temperature is chosen as the 
temperature of a black-body that has the same weighted mean frequency as has been computed in the simulation. Accordingly,

.. math::

    \frac{h \bar{\nu}}{k_{B} T_{R}} = \frac{h}{k_{B} T_{R}} \frac{\bar{\nu}_\textrm{estimator}}{J_\textrm{estimator}} 
      = 24 \zeta(5) \frac{15}{\pi^4},

where the evaluation comes from the mean value of

.. math::

    \bar{x} = \frac{ \int_0^{\infty} x^4 / (\exp{x} - 1)dx}{\int_0^{\infty} x^3 / (\exp{x} - 1)dx} =
    24 \zeta(5) \frac{15}{\pi^4} = 3.8322\dots

and so

.. math::

    T_{R} &= \frac{1}{\bar{x}} \frac{h}{k_{B}} \frac{\bar{\nu}_\textrm{estimator}}{J_\textrm{estimator}} \\
    &= 0.260945 \frac{h}{k_{B}} \frac{\bar{\nu}_\textrm{estimator}}{J_\textrm{estimator}}.

With the radiation temperature known, we can then obtain our estimate for the dilution factor. Our radiation field model in the 
nebular approximation is:

.. math::

    J = W B(T_{R}) = W \frac{\sigma_{SB}}{\pi} T_{R}^4,

i.e., a dilute black-body. Therefore we use our value of the mean intensity derived from the estimator (above) to obtain the 
dilution factor

.. math::

    W = \frac{\pi J}{\sigma_{SB} T_{R}^4} = \frac{1}{4\sigma_{SB} T_{R}^4\, \Delta t\, V} J_\textrm{estimator}.

There endeth the lesson.
