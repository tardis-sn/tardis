            Hi, human.

            I'm the @tardis-bot and couldn't find your records in my database. I think we don't know each other, or you changed your credentials recently.

            Please add your **name** and **email** to `.mailmap` in your current branch and push the changes to this pull request.

            In case you need to map an existing alias, follow [this example](https://docs.enterprise.codescene.io/versions/2.0.0/getting-started/ensure-you-use-a-mailmap.html).
        if: failure()
