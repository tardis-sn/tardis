          message: "Before a PR is accepted, it must meet the following criteria: \n
                - [ ] Is the necessary information provided? \n
                  \t - [ ] Does the PR have a complete description? Does it explain what the PR is attempting to do/fix, does it explain how it does this? \n
                  \t - [ ] Is there an explanation of why this PR is needed? \n
                  \t - [ ] Please use the [TARDIS PR template](https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) \n
                - [ ] Is this a duplicate PR? \n
                  \t - [ ] If a new PR is clearly a duplicate, ask how this PR is different from the original PR? \n
                  \t - [ ] If this PR is about to be merged, close the original PR with a link to this new PR that solved the issue. \n
                - [ ] Does it pass existing tests and are new tests provided if required? \n
                  \t - [ ] The test coverage should not decrease, and for new features should be at or very close to 100%. \n
                - [ ] Is the code properly documented? \n
                  \t - [ ] If this modifies existing code, then the docs should be updated. If this adds a new feature, additional documentation should be created. \n
                  \t - [ ] Sphinx and docstrings in the code (in numpydoc format) \n
                - [ ] Does this conform to PEP 8 and the TARDIS style guidelines? \n
                - [ ] Does the PR fix the problem it describes? \n
                  \t - [ ] Make sure it doesnâ€™t e.g. just fix the problem for a specific case \n
                  \t - [ ] Is this the best way of fixing the problem? \n
                - [ ] Is the code tidy? \n
                  \t - [ ] No unnecessary print lines or code comments \n"
