We would appreciate if the following acknowledgement is included in
publications using TARDIS:

.. code-block:: none

  This research made use of \textsc{Tardis}, a community-developed software
  package for spectral synthesis in supernovae. The development of
  \textsc{Tardis} received support from the Google Summer of Code initiative
  and from ESA's Summer of Code in Space program. \textsc{Tardis} makes
  extensive use of Astropy and PyNE.

User modifications and additions that lead to publications need to be handed
back to the community by incorporating them into this publicly available
version of TARDIS. Please contact the TARDIS team via the `github page
<https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis>`_ if you have questions or need
assistance.
