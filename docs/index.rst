TARDIS is an open-source Monte Carlo radiative-transfer spectral synthesis code
for 1D models of supernova ejecta. It is designed for rapid spectral modelling
of supernovae. It is developed and maintained by a :ref:`multi-disciplinary team <team>`
including software engineers, computer scientists, statisticians,
and astrophysicists.

If you use this code for any publications or presentations please follow our
citation guidelines in :ref:`tardiscredits`.

User modifications and additions that lead to publications **need to be handed
back to the community** by incorporating them into TARDIS.
Please contact the TARDIS team via the `GitHub page
<https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis>`_ if you have questions or need
assistance.

Mission Statement
-----------------

    *The mission of the TARDIS community is to develop open-source software 
    instruments to analyze and simulate astronomical transients 
    (supernovae, kilonovae, etc.) for research and education purposes. 
    We aim to build up a diverse group of researchers and developers 
    using an open-community model that emphasizes interdisciplinary 
    research and science reproducibility.*
