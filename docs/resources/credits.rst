Publication Policies
====================

If you use this code for any publications or presentations please acknowledge
it.  Please cite `Kerzendorf & Sim 2014
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440..387K>`_  in the text and add the
following paragraph to the Acknowledgement section:

.. parsed-literal::

    This research made use of \\textsc{tardis}, a community-developed software package for spectral
    synthesis in supernovae \\citep{2014MNRAS.440..387K, |ZENODO|}. The
    development of \\textsc{tardis} received support from GitHub, the Google Summer of Code
    initiative, and from ESA's Summer of Code in Space program. \\textsc{tardis} is a fiscally
    sponsored project of NumFOCUS. \\textsc{tardis} makes extensive use of Astropy and Pyne.

If you use any of the full relativity treatments or use TARDIS for modelling
Type II supernovae, also add `Spectral modeling of type II supernovae. I. Dilution factors <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...621A..29V>`_
to the Acknowledgement.
