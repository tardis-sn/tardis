    "A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts of the program execute (cProfile). A majority of TARDIS can be profiled, however, some code is Numba code, which cannot be profiled. This is because Numba compiles these functions directly to machine code; the python interpreter doesn’t see these functions and therefore it doesn’t read them.\n",
