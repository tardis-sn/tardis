TARDIS is under constant development. Thus, chances are high that some things
do not operate as intended. If any bugs, inconsistencies or missing
functionalities are found, file an issue on our official `github
<https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis>`_ page.

We encourage any interested user to actively contribute to the development of
TARDIS. Just follow some basic principles outlined on our :doc:`Contributing
HowTo <workflow/development_workflow>` and get started.
