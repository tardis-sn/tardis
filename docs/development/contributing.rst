*Imposter syndrome disclaimer*: We want your help. No really, we do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready;
that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework,
or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations
that you can read here (link).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to
follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit,
we hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code.
You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving
feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about
the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
