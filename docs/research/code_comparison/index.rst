Code Comparison
===============

Several groups have started a comparison of their supernova radiative transfer
codes to understand systematics uncertainties and different strategies.
The first meeting is summarized
`here <http://www.weizmann.ac.il/conferences/SRitp/June2018/resources>`_.

The description of file formats used can be found here
`<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQky4yq45z-KGbKG1MhLRivSP6RmEjte7nN-UZ0H-3M/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

For our code comparison, we will calculate spectra at 5, 10, 15, 20 days post-explosion.
