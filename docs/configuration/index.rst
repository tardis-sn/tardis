The bulk of the parameters for a TARDIS simulation are provided via a YAML
configuration file. In a first step, the integrity of the specified
configuration file is checked by a configuration validator. During this
process, missing entries are replaced by default values. The following sections
and pages provide more details concerning the TARDIS configuration process.
