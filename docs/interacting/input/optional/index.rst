Optional Inputs

TARDIS also allows other inputs that are passed as keyword arguments into the ``run_tardis`` function.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    custom_source
    callback_example
    logging_configuration


Additionally, ``run_tardis`` can take in a filepath for the atomic data and a boolean for virtual packet logging. For example:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from tardis.base import run_tardis

    sim = run_tardis('configuration_file', atom_data='filepath_to_atomic_data', virtual_packet_logging=True)

Both of these are also options in the :ref:`configuration file <config-components>`. The option to pass them inside ``run_tardis``
may be removed in a future release of the code.
