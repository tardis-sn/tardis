.. _development-workflow:

General Workflow to add a new feature
=====================================

In TARDIS we aim to stick to a test driven development. This uses the testing
framework extensively starting with a test that shows this feature lacking via
the implementation of the feature until the merging of the code to the main
repository.

In most cases we try to break down big features into small, quantifiable goals
which are then acted upon.

* Document feature to be added in an issue and maybe ask the mailing
  list if this feature exists
* Write a test that demonstrates what feature will be added.
* Run the test to verify that it fails in the way you think it should.
* If it fails in an unexpected way, your test may be wrong. This is a
  great time to ask the group for guidance
* If it passes, you are done! You just added test coverage to an
  already existing feature, and that is great! (unlikely)
* Add the feature (also known as "a simple matter of programming").
* Run the test to verify that it passes.
* Write documentation about your feature.
* close issue/partial PR and add to changelog.


Preparation and Working with Git
================================

In this document, we refer to the Tardis ``master`` branch as the *trunk*. The first step is to setup up a python environment. We recommend to use
Anaconda for this purpose and refer to our :doc:`Installation guide <../installation>` which covers this topic.

.. _forking:

Creating a fork
---------------

You need to do this only once for each package you want to contribute to. The
instructions here are very similar to the instructions at
http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ |emdash| please see that page for more
details. We're repeating some of it here just to give the specifics for the
TARDIS_ project, and to suggest some default names.

Set up and configure a GitHub account
-------------------------------------

If you don't have a GitHub account, go to the GitHub_ page and make one.

You then need to configure your account to allow write access |emdash| see
the `Generating SSH keys
<http://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys>`_ help on `GitHub Help`_.

Create your own fork of a repository
------------------------------------

The following example shows how to fork the core ``astropy`` repository, but
the same applies to other packages:

#. Log into your GitHub_ account.

#. Go to the `TARDIS GitHub`_ home page.

#. Click on the *fork* button:

   .. image:: images/Bootcamp-Fork.png

   After a short pause and an animation of Octocat scanning a book on a flatbed
   scanner, you should find yourself at the home page for your own forked copy
   of TARDIS_.

Setting up the fork to work on
------------------------------

.. _linking-to-upstream:

Overview
^^^^^^^^

This is done using::

    git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/tardis.git
    cd tardis
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis.git

In detail
^^^^^^^^^

#. Clone your fork to the local computer::

    git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/tardis.git

#. Change directory to your new repo::

    cd tardis

   Then type::

    git branch -a

   to show you all branches.  You'll get something like::

    * master
    remotes/origin/master

   This tells you that you are currently on the ``master`` branch, and
   that you also have a ``remote`` connection to ``origin/master``.
   What remote repository is ``remote/origin``? Try ``git remote -v`` to
   see the URLs for the remote connections.  They will point to your GitHub
   fork.

   Now connect to the TARDIS repository, so you can merge in changes from the
   trunk::

    cd
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis.git

   ``upstream`` is just the arbitrary name we're using to refer to the main
   TARDIS_ repository.

   Note that we've used ``git://`` for the URL rather than ``git@``. The
   ``git://`` URL is read only. This means that we can't accidentally (or
   deliberately) write to the upstream repo, and we are only going to use it
   to merge into our own code.

   Just for your own satisfaction, show yourself that you now have a new
   remote connection with ``git remote -v show``, which should give you
   something like::

    upstream   git://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis.git (fetch)
    upstream   git://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis.git (push)
    origin     git@github.com:your-user-name/tardis.git (fetch)
    origin     git@github.com:your-user-name/tardis.git (push)

   Your fork is now set up correctly, and you are ready to hack away.

Installing TARDIS in develop mode
---------------------------------

TARDIS is designed so that it can generally be used directly out of the source
tree by using ``import `` when running Python in the source of an
TARDIS repository clone.

#. Install TARDIS_ in develop mode::

       $ python setup.py develop

   This semi-permanently installs TARDIS on your path in such a way that
   ``tardis`` is always imported from your repository clone regardless of your
   working directory.  This way any edits you make to the code in your
   repository will always be immediately available next time you start a Python
   interpreter and ``import tardis``.

Workflow summary
----------------

This section gives a summary of the workflow to follow once you have
successfully forked the repository. The details for each of these steps are
given in the following sections.

* Don't use your ``master`` branch for anything.  Consider deleting it.

* When you are starting a new set of changes, fetch any changes from the
  trunk, then start a **new** *feature branch* from that (do not base your
  branch on your changes).

* Make a new branch for each separable set of changes |emdash| "one task, one
  branch" (`ipython git workflow`_).

* Name your branch for the purpose of the changes, for example
  ``bugfix-for-issue-14`` or ``refactor-database-code``.

* If you can possibly avoid it, don't merge the trunk or any other branches into
  your feature branch while you are working.

* If you do find yourself merging from the trunk, consider
  :ref:`rebase-on-trunk`

* Ask on the `tardis-sn-dev mailing list`_ if you get stuck.

* Once your code is nearing completion, run the test suite to ensure
  you have not accidentally caused regressions, and add new tests to ensure
  your contribution behaves correctly (see :ref:`testing-guidelines`).

* Issue a pull request on github!

* As the code is converging to a final state, ensure your
  documentation follows the guidelines (see :ref:`documentation-guidelines`).

* Once your code is ready to be accepted, please add an entry to the changelog
  (see :ref:`changelog-format`).  If you're sure where to put this, please at
  least suggest a brief (one or two sentence) description of your change so
  that another developer can add it to the changelog.

This way of working helps to keep work well organized, with readable history.
This in turn makes it easier for project maintainers (that might be you) to
see what you've done, and why you did it.

See `linux git workflow`_ and `ipython git workflow`_ for some explanation.

Deleting your master branch
---------------------------

It may sound strange, but deleting your own ``master`` branch can help reduce
confusion about which branch you are on.

.. _update-mirror-trunk:

Updating the mirror of trunk
----------------------------

From time to time you should fetch the upstream (trunk) changes from GitHub::

   git fetch upstream

This will pull down any commits you don't have, and set the remote branches to
point to the right commit. For example, 'trunk' is the branch referred to by
(remote/branchname) ``upstream/master``, and if there have been commits since
you last checked, ``upstream/master`` will change after you do the fetch.

.. _make-feature-branch:

Making a new feature branch
---------------------------

When you are ready to make some changes to the code, you should start a new
branch. Branches that are for a collection of related edits are often called
'feature branches'.

Making a new branch for each set of related changes will make it easier for
someone reviewing your branch to see what you are doing.

Choose an informative name for the branch to remind yourself and the rest of
us what the changes in the branch are for. For example ``add-ability-to-fly``,
or ``buxfix-for-issue-42``.

::

    # Update the mirror of trunk
    git fetch upstream

    # Make new feature branch starting at current trunk
    git checkout upstream/master # checking out the newest master versio
    git checkout -b my-new-feature

Generally, you will want to keep your feature branches on your public GitHub_
fork. To do this, you `git push`_ this new branch up to your
github repo. Generally (if you followed the instructions in these pages, and
by default), git will have a link to your GitHub repo, called ``origin``. You
push up to your own repo on GitHub with::

   git push origin my-new-feature

In git >= 1.7 you can ensure that the link is correctly set by using the
``--set-upstream`` option::

   git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature

From now on git will know that ``my-new-feature`` is related to the
``my-new-feature`` branch in the GitHub repo.

.. _edit-flow:

The editing workflow
--------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

Make changes, test, and::

   git add my_new_file
   git commit -m 'NF - some message'
   git push

In more detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Make some changes

#. Once you are a bit further along, test your changes do not lead to
   regressions, and add new tests (see the Astropy :ref:`testing-guidelines` we follow).::

     python setup.py test

   If you have sphinx installed, you can also check that the documentation
   builds and looks correct::

     python setup.py build_sphinx

   The last line should just state ``build succeeded``, and should not mention
   any warnings.  (For more details, see the Astropy
   :ref:`documentation-guidelines` we follow.)

#. See which files have changed with ``git status`` (see `git status`_).
   You'll see a listing like this one::

     # On branch ny-new-feature
     # Changed but not updated:
     #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
     #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
     #
     #    modified:   README
     #
     # Untracked files:
     #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
     #
     #    INSTALL
     no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

#. Check what the actual changes are with ``git diff`` (see `git diff`_).

#. Add any new files to version control with ``git add new_file_name`` (see
   `git add`_).

#. Add any modified files that you want to commit using
   ``git add modified_file_name``  (see `git add`_).

#. Once you are ready to commit, check with ``git status`` which files are
   about to be committed::

    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #    modified:   README

   Then use ``git commit -m 'A commit message'``. The ``m`` flag just
   signals that you're going to type a message on the command line. The `git
   commit`_ manual page might also be useful.

#. Push the changes up to your forked repo on GitHub with ``git push`` (see
   `git push`_).

Asking for your changes to be reviewed and/or merged
----------------------------------------------------

When you are ready to ask for someone to review your code and consider a merge:

#. Go to the URL of your forked repo, e.g.,
   ``http://github.com/your-user-name/tardis``.

#. Use the 'Switch Branches' dropdown menu near the top left of the page to
   select the branch with your changes:

   .. image:: images/branch_dropdown.png

#. Click on the 'Pull request' button:

   .. image:: images/pull_button.png

   Enter a title for the set of changes, and some explanation of what you've
   done. If there is anything you'd like particular attention for, like a
   complicated change or some code you are not happy with, add the details
   here.

   If you don't think your request is ready to be merged, just say so in your
   pull request message.  This is still a good way to start a preliminary
   code review.

.. _using-virtualenv:

Making sure your Pull request stays up-to-date
----------------------------------------------

More often then not it will take a few days until a Pull Request is
merged as the community gives feedback and/or you add new fixes. During this
time often other pull requests are merged and the master branch evolves further.
To make sure that your changes are still working on the new master you want to
*rebase* your branch ontop of the evolved master


Rebasing on trunk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's say you thought of some work you'd like to do. You
:ref:`update-mirror-trunk` and :ref:`make-feature-branch` called
``cool-feature``. At this stage trunk is at some commit, let's call it E. Now
you make some new commits on your ``cool-feature`` branch, let's call them A,
B, C. Maybe your changes take a while, or you come back to them after a while.
In the meantime, trunk has progressed from commit E to commit (say) G::

          A---B---C cool-feature
         /
    D---E---F---G trunk

At this stage you consider merging trunk into your feature branch, and you
remember that this here page sternly advises you not to do that, because the
history will get messy. Most of the time you can just ask for a review, and
not worry that trunk has got a little ahead. But sometimes, the changes in
trunk might affect your changes, and you need to harmonize them. In this
situation you may prefer to do a rebase.

Rebase takes your changes (A, B, C) and replays them as if they had been made
to the current state of ``trunk``. In other words, in this case, it takes the
changes represented by A, B, C and replays them on top of G. After the rebase,
your history will look like this::

                  A'--B'--C' cool-feature
                 /
    D---E---F---G trunk

See `rebase without tears`_ for more detail.

To do a rebase on trunk::

    # Update the mirror of trunk
    git fetch upstream

    # Go to the feature branch
    git checkout cool-feature

    # Make a backup in case you mess up
    git branch tmp cool-feature

    # Rebase cool-feature onto trunk
    git rebase --onto upstream/master upstream/master cool-feature

In this situation, where you are already on branch ``cool-feature``, the last
command can be written more succinctly as::

    git rebase upstream/master

When all looks good you can delete your backup branch::

   git branch -D tmp

If it doesn't look good you may need to have a look at
:ref:`recovering-from-mess-up`.

If you have made changes to files that have also changed in trunk, this may
generate merge conflicts that you need to resolve - see the `git rebase`_ man
page for some instructions at the end of the "Description" section. There is
some related help on merging in the git user manual - see `resolving a
merge`_.

If your feature branch is already on GitHub and you rebase, you will have to
force push the branch; a normal push would give an error. If the branch you
rebased is called ``cool-feature`` and your GitHub fork is available as the
remote called ``origin``, you use this command to force-push::

   git push -f origin cool-feature

Note that this will overwrite the branch on GitHub, i.e. this is one of the few
ways you can actually lose commits with git. Also note that it is never allowed
to force push to the main astropy repo (typically called ``upstream``), because
this would re-write commit history and thus cause problems for all others.

.. _recovering-from-mess-up:

Recovering from mess-ups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, you mess up merges or rebases. Luckily, in git it is relatively
straightforward to recover from such mistakes.

If you mess up during a rebase::

   git rebase --abort

If you notice you messed up after the rebase::

   # Reset branch back to the saved point
   git reset --hard tmp

If you forgot to make a backup branch::

   # Look at the reflog of the branch
   git reflog show cool-feature

   8630830 cool-feature@{0}: commit: BUG: io: close file handles immediately
   278dd2a cool-feature@{1}: rebase finished: refs/heads/my-feature-branch onto 11ee694744f2552d
   26aa21a cool-feature@{2}: commit: BUG: lib: make seek_gzip_factory not leak gzip obj
   ...

   # Reset the branch to where it was before the botched rebase
   git reset --hard cool-feature@{2}


Reviewing and helping others with Pull Requests
-----------------------------------------------

Github offers an extensive array of tools to comment on Pull Requests (line
based, normal forum-like discussion, etc.). This system is described here in
detail `<http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_.

However sometimes, it is easier to just add a few changes yourself to quickly
show what you would suggest to be changed. So it is possible to make a
Pull Request on a Pull Request.

There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to first make sure
that your local git-repository understands the concept of pull-requests.
So just add in your <my-project>/.git/config the following line to your remote
upstream::

    [remote "upstream"]
        url = git@github.com:tardis-sn/tardis.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
        fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*


Then fetch from `upstream` again::

    git fetch upstream
    remote: Counting objects: 77, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (72/72), done.
    remote: Total 77 (delta 44), reused 9 (delta 5)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (77/77), done.
    From github.com:tardis-sn/tardis
       b8306de..2f47ee5  master     -> upstream/master
     * [new ref]         refs/pull/116/head -> upstream/pr/116
     * [new ref]         refs/pull/117/head -> upstream/pr/117
     * [new ref]         refs/pull/118/head -> upstream/pr/118

and now it is possible to *check out* a the pull request branch, in this case PR
116::

    git checkout upstream/pr/116
    git checkout upstream/pr/116
    Note: checking out 'upstream/pr/116'.

    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
    state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

    If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
    do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

      git checkout -b new_branch_name

    HEAD is now at b1f32ba... added the git workflow still WIP

Finally, you can make a new branch `git checkout -b helping-with-PR116` and work
implement your work.

After committing your changes you push your change to your repository
`git push origin helping-with-PR116`.
