******************
Developer Workflow
******************

Many of the Development workflow is taken from `Astropy <http://docs.astropy.org
/en/stable/development/workflow/development_workflow.html>`_ and credit belongs
to the Astropy team for designing it.

The first step is to setup up a python environment. :doc:`python_environment`
explains how to do that.

:doc:`git_workflow` describes how to interact with git and github in the development
 of TARDIS.


General Workflow to add a new feature
=====================================

In TARDIS we aim to stick to a test driven development. This uses the testing
framework extensively starting with a test that shows this feature lacking via
the implementation of the feature until the merging of the code to the main
repository.

In most cases we try to break down big features into small, quantifiable goals
which are then acted upon.

 * Document feature to be added in an issue and maybe ask the mailing
   list if this feature exists
 * Write a test that demonstrates what feature will be added.
 * Run the test to verify that it fails in the way you think it should.
 * If it fails in an unexpected way, your test may be wrong. This is a
   great time to ask the group for guidance
 * If it passes, you are done! You just added test coverage to an
   already existing feature, and that is great! (unlikely)
 * Add the feature (also known as "a simple matter of programming").
 * Run the test to verify that it passes.
 * Write documentation about your feature.
 * close issue/partial PR and add to changelog.
