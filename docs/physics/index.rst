This part of the documentation is dedicated to providing some physical and
astrophysical background for TARDIS. If you do not find the information you are
looking for, consult the official TARDIS publications and the references therein.

Eventually, information about the following topics will be provided

* Spectral Synthesis in SNe Ia ejecta
* Radiative Transfer Primer
* Reference Frames
* Nuclear Decay
* TARDIS Simulation Procedure
* Plasma State Calculation

======================================

.. note::
    The following entries reflects the physics section of the old TARDIS
    documentation. Even though this section of the documentation is partly
    outdated, many basic concepts are still applicable to the current TARDIS
