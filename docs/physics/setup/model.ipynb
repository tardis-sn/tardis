    "We now look at how TARDIS models the density inside each shell. If you use the [built-in densities](../../io/configuration/components/models/index.rst#density), TARDIS allows you to choose between the four models discussed below. The [file structure](../../io/configuration/components/models/index.rst#file-structure), [CSVY model](../../io/configuration/components/models/index.rst#csvy-model), and [custom abundance widget](../../io/visualization/abundance_widget.ipynb) options allow more freedom in assigning densities to each shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the density in the supernova at a specific moment in time is a function of the radius or velocity of the ejecta (either canbe used, since the radius and velocity are linearly related at any moment of time). Since the shell velocities do not change over time, it is more simple to write the densities as a function of ejecta velocity. If we do this, the time-dependence of the density is simple. We know the total mass of the ejecta is constant in each shell due to the nature of homologous expansion. The inner and outer radii of each shell increases linearly over time, meaning the volume increases as time cubed. Since density is mass divided by volume, the density is inverse-cubic in time. Mathematically, if $\\rho(v,t_\\mathrm{explosion})$ is the density at a velocity $v$ after a time $t_\\mathrm{explosion}$, given some characteristic time $t_0$, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho(v,t_\\mathrm{explosion})=\\rho(v,t_0)*\\left(\\frac{t_0}{t_\\mathrm{explosion}}\\right)^3$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the state of the ejecta, including the density, is the same throughout the shell, we determine the shell's density by plugging the velocity/radius at the center of the shell into the density function. We now explore the various built-in density profiles. For each profile, we build an example model using the density profile and example parameters (which can be varied in interactive mode), print the densities in each shell, and show a graph of density versus radius (specifically the radius at the center of each shell).\n",
