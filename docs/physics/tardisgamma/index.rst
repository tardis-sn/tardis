TARDIS-High Energy
******************
This code module simulates the propagation of high energy photons through the ejecta and can be used to study the transport of high energy photons within the ejecta as well as the energy deposition of high energy photons and positrons.

Thermonuclear supernovae are powered by the radioactive decay of :sup:`56` Ni and :sup:`56` Co. The photons produced by the radioactive decay often are not able to escape the ejecta until later times in the supernova when the density decreases. Once the high energy photons are able to escape they can provide information about the mass and distribution of radioactive isotopes created in the supernova.

The code can also be used to study the :math:`\gamma`-ray spectra and energy deposited by radioactive isotopes in radioactively powered transients.
