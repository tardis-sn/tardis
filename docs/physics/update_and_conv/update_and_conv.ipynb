Recall that each of these quantities takes on a different value in each shell.\n",

The equation for $W$ comes from the fact that the dilution factor is the ratio of the actual mean intensity to that of a blackbody, which is $J_{\\mathrm{blackbody}}=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}} T^4}{\\pi}$.\n",

    "Recall (see [Implementation](../montecarlo/estimators.rst#implementation)), however, that when TARDIS stores these estimators, it leaves out the prefactor of $\\frac{1}{4\\pi V\\Delta t}$ for computational ease.

    "While TARDIS can then update the plasma state using the estimated values, there is a good chance that these estimated values would “overshoot” the true value we want to converge to (for example, if the current value of the dilution factor in some cell the dilution factor is 0.4, and the true steady-state value TARDIS wants to find is 0.45, there is a good chance that the estimated value will be greater than 0.45). This could make the simulation take longer to converge or, at worst, make it so the simulation does not converge at all. To account for this, users can set (in the convergence configuration) a \"damping constant\" for both the radiative temperature ($d_{T_\\mathrm{rad}}$) and the dilution factor ($d_W$). When ``advance_state`` is called, these quantities update as follows:\n",

    "## $T_\\mathrm{inner}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature of the inner boundary, $T_\\mathrm{inner}$, plays a unique role in the simulation, as it is the primary determiner of the output luminosity. This is because the the luminosity of the inner boundary is proportional to $T_\\mathrm{inner}^4$ (see [Energy Packet Initialization](../montecarlo/initialization.ipynb)). Thus, $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ is updated throughout the simulation in order to match the output luminosity to the requested luminosity specified in the [supernova configuration](../../io/configuration/components/supernova.rst) between the bounds specified in the supernova configuration. However, there is not necessarily a quartic relationship between $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ and the output luminosity, as changing $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ also changes the frequency distribution of the initialized packets (once again see [Energy Packet Initialization](../montecarlo/initialization.ipynb)). This then affects the light-matter interactions, affecting which packets make it to the outer boundary, which also affects the output luminosity. Because of this, there is not an exact way to estimate $T_\\mathrm{inner}$. To do this estimation, we use\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_\\mathrm{inner\\ estimated} = T_\\mathrm{inner\\ current} * \\left(\\frac{L_\\mathrm{output}}{L_\\mathrm{requested}}\\right)^{\\mathrm{t\\_inner\\_update\\_exponent}}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where $L_\\mathrm{output}$ is the output luminosity calculated by adding up the luminosity of each packet (see [Basic Spectrum Generation](../spectrum/basic.ipynb)) between the bounds specified in the [supernova configuration](../../io/configuration/components/supernova.rst), $L_\\mathrm{requested}$ is the luminosity requested also in the supernova configuration (requested between those bounds previously mentioned), and ``t_inner_update_exponent`` is provided by the user in the convergence configuration. Note that what we are doing is \"correcting\" the previous value of the inner temperature by a factor of $\\left(\\frac{L_\\mathrm{output}}{L_\\mathrm{requested}}\\right)^{\\mathrm{t\\_inner\\_update\\_exponent}}$. Note that if $\\frac{L_\\mathrm{output}}{L_\\mathrm{requested}}$ is greater than 1, we want to lower $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ as the output luminosity is too high, and vice versa if the ratio is less than 1. Thus ``t_inner_update_exponent`` should be negative. Naively one might set ``t_inner_update_exponent=-0.25``, however as a default TARDIS uses ``t_inner_update_exponent=-0.5`` as -0.25 may undershoot the correct $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ because of its previously mentioned effects on the initial frequency distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating the estimated $T_\\mathrm{inner}$, the quantity is updated using damped convergence with its own damping constant (once again set in the convergence configuration):\n",

    "Once again, If the damping constant is 1, then the updated value is exactly the estimated value, and if the damping constant is zero, the value stays the same throughout the simulation and is not updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, because of the vast impact of $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ on the simulation, one may want to update it less frequently -- i.e. allow $W$ and $T_\\mathrm{rad}$ to reach a steady-state value for a particular $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ before updating $T_\\mathrm{inner}$. To do this, in the convergence configuration we set ``lock_t_inner_cycles``, which is the number of iterations to wait before updating $T_\\mathrm{inner}$. It is set to 1 by default, meaning $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ would be updated every iteration."

Otherwise, the `j_blues` values in the plasma are calculated as they typically are in the plasma calculations, and the $J^b_{lu}$ estimator is only used for the [formal integral](../spectrum/formal_integral.rst).
