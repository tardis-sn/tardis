    "# Energy Packet Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is instructive to think about tracking the propagation history of\n",
    "individual photons when illustrating the basic idea behind Monte Carlo radiative transfer\n",
    "techniques, there are important numerical reasons for using a different\n",
    "discretization scheme. Instead of thinking in the photon picture, it brings\n",
    "significant advantages to follow the idea of <strong data-cite=\"Abbott1985\">[]</strong> and\n",
    "<strong data-cite=\"Lucy1999\">[]</strong> and consider parcels of radiant energy as the fundamental\n",
    "building blocks of the Monte Carlo calculation. These basic Monte Carlo quanta\n",
    "are commonly referred to as \"energy packets\" or simply \"packets\", and are composed of many photons with the same frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a Monte Carlo calculation, $N$ (a large number) packets, all with a certain\n",
    "energy $\\varepsilon$, are created at the inner boundary of the computational domain (which is discussed in the [model section](../setup/model.rst)) known as the photosphere. Currently, the photosphere is modeled as a spherical [blackbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) with a radius $r_\\mathrm{boundary\\_inner}$ and temperature $T_\\mathrm{inner}$. Both of these quantities are calculated as a part of the [model](../setup/model.ipynb), and $T_\\mathrm{inner}$ is additionally updated throughout the simulation as a part of the [Updating Plasma and Convergence](../update_and_conv/update_and_conv.ipynb) process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TARDIS, all packets are assigned identical energies **in the lab frame** (see [Reference Frames](propagation.rst#reference-frames)), and the total (lab-frame) energy of the packets is 1 erg (and thus each packet has an energy of $\\frac{1}{N}$ ergs).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "The indivisible energy packet scheme does not require that all packets have the same energy. This is just a convenient and simple choice adopted in TARDIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all packets have the same total, and photon energy is proportional to frequency, higher-frequency packets will represent less real photons than lower-frequency packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the photosphere is modeled as a blackbody, its total luminosity $L_\\mathrm{inner}$ (recall that luminosity is energy emitted divided by the time in which it is emitted) is\n",
    "$$L_\\mathrm{inner}=\\frac{N\\varepsilon}{\\Delta t}=4 \\pi r_\\mathrm{boundary\\_inner}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}} T_{\\mathrm{inner}}^4$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma_\\mathrm{R}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $\\Delta t$ is the physical duration of the simulation. In order to make this relationship hold (remembering that $N\\varepsilon = 1$ erg), we use\n",
    "$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{L_\\mathrm{inner}}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi r_\\mathrm{boundary\\_inner}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}} T_{\\mathrm{inner}}^4}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "As will be shown in the code example, this will lead to unphysically small values for $\\Delta t$. It may be easier to think of the Monte Carlo packets not as packets of energy $\\epsilon$ going through a simulation of duration $\\Delta t$, but as packets of luminosity that carry an energy $\\epsilon$ over a time $\\Delta t$ (and thus truly being luminosity packets of luminosity $\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\Delta t}$). Indeed, this view of the packets will be useful when deriving the [Monte Carlo Estimators](estimators.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "During packet initialization, each packet is assigned an initial propagation direction $\\mu$ which is the cosine of the angle $\\theta$ which the packet's path makes with the radial direction (see the image below). Using a pseudo-random number generator which generates numbers $z$ uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$, the propagation direction is determined (due to physical considerations beyond the scope of this documentation) according to\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\sqrt{z}.$$\n",
    "This sampling is shown in the \"Code Example\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/propagation_direction.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each packet is assigned an initial frequency (or more precisely, the initial frequency of its constituent photons). Note that since each packet has the same energy, each packet will represent a different number of real photons. The sampling on packet frequencies is more involved than that of the propagation direction, as it involves sampling the Planck distribution (see below). TARDIS uses the technique described in <strong data-cite=\"Carter1975\">[]</strong> and summarized in <strong data-cite=\"Bjorkman2001\">[]</strong> for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the simulation, the energy of the packet remains constant in the local\n",
    "co-moving frame (see [Reference Frames](propagation.rst#reference-frames)). This naturally ensures energy\n",
    "conservation and constitutes the main advantage of this discretization scheme. **However, while the energy of the packets is conserved in the co-moving frame, the co-moving frequency of the packet (and thus the photons represented by the packet) may vary over the course of the simulation. Thus, a packet may represent several different numbers of real photons throughout their lifetimes.**\n",
