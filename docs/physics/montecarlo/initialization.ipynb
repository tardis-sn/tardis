    "While it is instructive to think about tracking the propagation history of\n",
    "photons when illustrating the basic idea behind Monte Carlo radiative transfer\n",
    "techniques, there are important numerical reasons for using a different\n",
    "discretization scheme. Instead of thinking in the photon picture, it brings\n",
    "significant advantages to follow the idea of <strong data-cite=\"Abbott1985\">[]</strong> and\n",
    "<strong data-cite=\"Lucy1999\">[]</strong> and consider parcels of radiant energy as the fundamental\n",
    "building blocks of the Monte Carlo calculation. These basic Monte Carlo quanta\n",
    "are commonly referred to as \"energy packets\" or simply \"packets\", and are composed of many photons with the same frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a Monte Carlo calculation, $N$ (a large number) packets, all with a certain\n",
    "energy $\\varepsilon$, are created at the inner boundary of the computational domain (as will be discussed in [Packet Propagation](propagation.rst)) known as the photosphere. Currently, the photosphere is modeled as a spherical blackbody with a radius $R_\\mathrm{phot}$ and temperature $T_\\mathrm{phot}$. In TARDIS, all packets are assigned identical energies, and the total energy of the packets is 1 erg (and thus each packet has an energy of $\\frac{1}{N}$ ergs).\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note:: The indivisible energy packet scheme does not require that all packets have the same energy. This is just a convenient and simple choice adopted in TARDIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the photosphere is modeled as a blackbody, its total luminosity $L$ (recall that luminosity is energy emitted divided by the time in which it is emitted) is\n",
    "$$L=\\frac{N\\varepsilon}{\\Delta t}=4 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{phot}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}} T_{\\mathrm{phot}}^4$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma_\\mathrm{R}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $\\Delta t$ is the physical duration of the simulation. In order to make this relationship hold (remembering that $N\\varepsilon = 1$ erg), we use\n",
    "$$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{L}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{phot}}^2 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{R}} T_{\\mathrm{phot}}^4}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "During packet initialization, each packet is assigned an initial propagation direction $\\mu$ which is the cosine of the angle $\\theta$ which the packet's path makes with the radial direction. Using a pseudo-random number generator which generates numbers $z$ uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$, the propagation direction is determined according to\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\sqrt{z}.$$\n",
    "This sampling is demonstrated in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each packet is assigned an initial frequency (or more precisely, the initial frequency of its consitiuent photons). Note that since each packet has the same energy, each packet will represent a different number of real photons. The sampling on packet frequencies is more involved than that of the propagation direction, as it involves sampling the Planck distribution (see below). TARDIS uses the technique described in <strong data-cite=\"Carter1975\">[]</strong> and summarized in <strong data-cite=\"Bjorkman2001\">[]</strong> for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the simulation, the energy of the packet remains constant in the local\n",
    "co-moving frame (see [Reference Frames](propagation.rst#reference-frames)). This naturally ensures energy\n",
    "conservation and constitutes the main advantage of this discretization scheme. **However, while the energy of the packets is conserved in the co-moving frame, the frequency of the constituent photons (in the local co-moving frame) may vary over the course of the simulation. Thus, a packet may represent several different numbers of real photons throughout their lifetimes.**\n",
