    "The first and most simple way in which TARDIS calculates spectra is by calculating it directly from the Monte Carlo packets after the final [Monte Carlo Iteration](../montecarlo/index.rst). This simply requires knowledge of each packet's energy and frequency in the lab frame (see [Reference Frames](../montecarlo/propagation.rst#reference-frames)) at the end of the iteration. The only other quantity needed is the time duration of the simulation $\\Delta t$, which is calculated based off of the luminosity of the supernova's photosphere (see [Energy Packet Initialization](../montecarlo/initialization.ipynb)).\n",

We then add up the luminosities of each packet in the bin and divide by the \"width\" of the bins. For example, if we are plotting between 0 Hz and 50 Hz in 5 bins, we would add up the luminosities of the packets between 0 Hz and 10 Hz, between 10 Hz and 20 Hz, between 20 Hz and 30 Hz, etc., and then divide each value by 10 Hz, which is the width of each bin (note that the bin widths need not be uniform). This will give us the luminosity density with respect to frequency, denoted by $L_\\nu$, and measured in ergs per second per Hertz. This can be interpreted as the luminosity per unit Hertz, i.e. how much luminosity will be in an interval with a width of 1 Hz.\n",
