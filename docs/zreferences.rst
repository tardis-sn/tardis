    Chianti
        CHIANTI consists of a critically evaluated set of up-to-date atomic data, together with user-friendly programs written in Interactive Data Language (IDL) and Python to calculate the spectra from astrophysical plasmas.
    
    Meta-Stable
        Metastability is the condition of a system where the system has stability, but is not as stable as in the system's state of least energy.
    
    Synapps
        SYNAPPS is an open-source spectrum fitter embedding a highly parameterized synthetic SN spectrum calculation within a parallel asynchronous optimizer, created to systematically interpret large sets of SN spectroscopy data.
    
    TOML
        TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is a minimal configuration file format that is designed to be easy to read due to obvious semantics. It is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table and to be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages. TOML files have the ending ".toml".
    
    YAML
        YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML files have the ending ".yml".
