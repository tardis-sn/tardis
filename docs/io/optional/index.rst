TARDIS also allows other inputs that are passed as arguments into the ``run_tardis`` function.

    :maxdepth: 1

    custom_source
    callback_example


Additionally, ``run_tardis`` can take in a filepath for the atomic data and a boolian for virtual packet logging, both of
which are also options in the :ref:`configuration file <config-components>`. The options to pass them inside ``run_tardis``
may be removed in a future release of the code.
