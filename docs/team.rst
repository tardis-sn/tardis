TARDIS is developed by a multidisciplinary team. We adhere to the Astropy
`code of conduct <https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html>`_.

The development of TARDIS and associated software tools are made possible through several coordination roles fulfilled by community members. This encompasses a broad scope of responsibilities ranging from direct package development to communication, distribution, and managerial activities.

The roles and their description can be found here:
