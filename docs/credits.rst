    This research made use of \textsc{tardis}, a community-developed software
    package for spectral synthesis in supernovae.
    The development of \textsc{tardis} received support from the
    Google Summer of Code initiative
    and from ESA's Summer of Code in Space program. \textsc{tardis} makes
    extensive use of Astropy \citep{astropy:2013, astropy:2018} and PyNE.
