    This research made use of \textsc{Tardis}, a community-developed software
    package for spectral synthesis in supernovae
    \citep{2014MNRAS.440..387K, kerzendorf_wolfgang_2019_2590539}.
    The development of \textsc{Tardis} received support from the
    Google Summer of Code initiative
    and from ESA's Summer of Code in Space program. \textsc{Tardis} makes
    extensive use of Astropy and PyNE.



If you use any of the full relativity treatments or use TARDIS for
modelling Type II supernovae, you also add this citation to acknowledgement
`Spectral modeling of type II supernovae. I. Dilution factors
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...621A..29V>`_:
