Name: libdeflate
Description: Fast implementation of DEFLATE, zlib, and gzip
Version: 1.20
Libs: -L${libdir} -ldeflate
Cflags: -I${includedir}

# Note: this library's public header allows LIBDEFLATE_DLL to be defined when
# linking to the DLL on Windows, to make __declspec(dllimport) be used.
# However, the only way to define a shared-library-only flag in a pkgconfig file
# is to use the weird workaround of unconditionally defining it in Cflags, then
# undefining it in Cflags.private.  Just don't bother with this, since
# __declspec(dllimport) is optional anyway.  It is a very minor performance
# optimization that is irrelevant for most use cases of libdeflate.
