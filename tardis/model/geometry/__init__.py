"""
Holding information about model geometry for radial 1D models.

The information stored about the model are the following attributes:
r_inner : The radius of the inner shell boundaries
r_outer : The radius of the outer shell boundaries
v_inner : The velocity of the inner boundaries of each shell
v_outer : The velocity of the outer boundaries of each shell
volume : Volume of each shell computed from r_outer and r_inner
